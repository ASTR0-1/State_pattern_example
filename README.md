‚ô¶Ô∏è<b>State_pattern_example</b>

<i>This is the example of Behavioral pattern State. Made for Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.</i>

üéØThe task is:

<i>
<pre>
  Implement the task of simulating the operation of an ATM.
  Assume that the user may enter a wrong PIN code,
  the ATM may not have enough money to complete the user's transaction,
  ATM may be blocked (there may be no money in it), on the card.
</pre>
</i>

‚ÑπÔ∏è<b>Some info about that pattern:</b>

<i>
The Behavioral Design Patterns deal with the communication or interaction between Classes and objects. The interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they are talking to each other and still are loosely coupled. The loose coupling is the key to n-tier architecture.

So, a behavioral pattern explains how objects interact. It describes how different objects and classes send messages to each other to make things happen and how the steps of a task are divided among different objects.
